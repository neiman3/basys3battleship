# about this project
This project was created by Jenna Mast and Alex Neiman for CPE133 final project at Cal Poly. This is original code, with the exception of all clock divider modules, provided by Dr. Mealy. Those modules are attributed to him and are clearly indicated in the comment section of those files.
